# Fruit-Fly-and-Yeast-Orthologs

The result is the best significant E-value for every query in the blast_results.xml file that has a significant E-value.  A significant E-value is considered less than 1e-5.  The result also has the overall best E-value for the entire blast_results.xml file.  

The program imports NCBIXML to be able to parse the XML file.  It saves the best yeast matches for each fruit fly query into a dictionary.  It iterates through each blast result and got each fruit fly protein's query_id.  It saves an infinity place holder for each best E-value to be able to track the smallest and most significant E-value.  It initializes the best_hit as None to store the best yeast protein match for the query.  It then iterates over all the alignments for the query and their respective HSPs.  After, it checks if the E-value of the current HSP is less than 1e-5 which is the threshold for a significant match.  If the value is smaller than the best_e_value, it updates the best_e_value and sets the best_hit value to that yeast protein.  It then stores the query's best yeast protein and corresponding E-value to the best_hits dictionary.  The program then iterates through all of the best_hit dictionary entries and prints the fruit fly query number, its best yeast protein match, and its E-value.  It also finds the query with the smallest E-value across every best_hit entry and prints its query number, best yeast match, and E-value.
